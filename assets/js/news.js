    After a year of hard work and many late nights, it has finally paid off. We are very proud to have taken our vehicle, R18, to three North American Competitions and after participating in the final competition in Washougal, WA come out as the North American Baja SAE Champion. Most of all, we are proud to bring home the Mike Schmidt award showing our immense overall achievement, while honoring the roots that we grew from.
    
    Mike Schmidt was a founding member of RIT's Baja team and this award is named in his honor and given to the team with the most points overall, from all 3 North American competitions during the year. With just 2 points differentiating the top teams out of a possible 3000,we are extremely humbled by this honor and thank our competitors for an engineering challenge and life defining experience. The competition was incredible and the races were intense. We have grown so much as a team and as engineers and can't wait to see what the future has in store for the organization.
